# eXifMarksTheSpot

**eXifMarksTheSpot** is a digital forensics tool designed to extract and visualize geolocation and metadata from image files. It scans a folder of JPEG images, retrieves GPS coordinates from EXIF metadata (if available), computes MD5 file hashes, and generates:

- An interactive HTML report
- A KML file for mapping in tools like Google Earth

This tool helps to present visual GPS metadata of where and when photos were taken from their metadata.
